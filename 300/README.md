# Learning Rancher Security

A comprehensive repository for learning and implementing security best practices in Rancher, the Kubernetes management platform.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource and practical toolkit for cybersecurity engineers focusing on securing Rancher deployments. It includes security auditing tools, hardening guides, and hands-on examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Tool: Rancher Security Audit Scanner

A Python-based security audit tool that analyzes Rancher deployments for common security misconfigurations and provides actionable recommendations.

### Features

- **Authentication & Authorization Auditing**: Validates RBAC configurations and user permissions
- **Secret Management Analysis**: Detects exposed secrets and weak encryption practices
- **Network Policy Verification**: Checks for proper network segmentation
- **Pod Security Standards**: Validates PSP/PSA enforcement
- **TLS/SSL Configuration**: Verifies certificate validity and encryption settings
- **API Security**: Checks for exposed APIs and authentication mechanisms
- **Compliance Checking**: Validates against CIS Kubernetes and Rancher benchmarks
- **Report Generation**: Creates detailed security assessment reports

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to a Rancher instance (API endpoint and credentials)
- kubectl configured (for cluster-level checks)
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes and Rancher architecture

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Learning-Rancher-Security.git
cd Learning-Rancher-Security

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your Rancher credentials
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your Rancher details
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run a full security audit
python rancher_security_audit.py --config config.yaml --full-scan

# Run specific checks
python rancher_security_audit.py --config config.yaml --check authentication
python rancher_security_audit.py --config config.yaml --check secrets

# Generate HTML report
python rancher_security_audit.py --config config.yaml --output report.html
```

## üîí Security Topics Covered

### 1. Authentication & Access Control

- Local authentication vs. external providers (AD, LDAP, SAML, OAuth)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement
- API key rotation and management
- Service account security

### 2. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

- Global roles vs. cluster roles vs. project roles
- Principle of least privilege implementation
- Custom role creation and auditing
- Permission boundaries

### 3. Secrets Management

- Kubernetes secrets encryption at rest
- External secrets management integration (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Secret rotation policies
- Prevention of secrets in environment variables

### 4. Network Security

- Network policy enforcement
- Ingress/Egress rules
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)
- Private registry configuration

### 5. Pod Security

- Pod Security Policies (PSP) - deprecated
- Pod Security Admission (PSA) - current standard
- Security contexts and capabilities
- Resource limits and quotas

### 6. TLS/SSL Configuration

- Certificate management
- Internal cluster communication encryption
- Ingress controller SSL termination
- Certificate rotation automation

### 7. Audit Logging

- Rancher audit log configuration
- Kubernetes audit policies
- Log aggregation and monitoring
- SIEM integration

### 8. Supply Chain Security

- Image scanning and vulnerability management
- Trusted registry enforcement
- Image signature verification
- Admission controllers (OPA, Kyverno)

## üìö Learning Path

1. **Beginner**: Understand Rancher architecture and basic security concepts
1. **Intermediate**: Implement RBAC, network policies, and pod security standards
1. **Advanced**: Integrate external security tools, implement zero-trust, automate security scanning
1. **Expert**: Develop custom security policies, contribute to Rancher security, red team exercises

## üîç Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Detecting Exposed Secrets

The audit tool will flag:

- Secrets stored in ConfigMaps
- Environment variables containing sensitive data
- Unencrypted secrets at rest
- Hardcoded credentials in deployment manifests

### Scenario 2: RBAC Misconfiguration

Identifies:

- Overly permissive cluster-admin bindings
- Service accounts with excessive privileges
- Missing resource quotas in projects
- Wildcard permissions in roles

### Scenario 3: Network Policy Gaps

Detects:

- Namespaces without network policies
- Unrestricted ingress/egress rules
- Missing default-deny policies
- Exposed internal services

## üìä Sample Report Output

```
=== RANCHER SECURITY AUDIT REPORT ===
Date: 2025-10-18
Rancher Version: v2.8.0
Clusters Scanned: 3

CRITICAL FINDINGS: 2
HIGH FINDINGS: 5
MEDIUM FINDINGS: 12
LOW FINDINGS: 8

[CRITICAL] Cluster 'production' has no pod security policies enforced
[CRITICAL] API tokens found with no expiration date

[HIGH] 15 secrets detected without encryption at rest
[HIGH] Cluster 'staging' allows privileged containers
...
```

## üß™ Lab Environment Setup

Instructions for setting up a test Rancher environment for security practice:

```bash
# Deploy Rancher in Docker (testing only)
docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \
  -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  --privileged \
  rancher/rancher:latest

# Or use Helm for production-like setup
helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
kubectl create namespace cattle-system
helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  --set hostname=rancher.example.com
```

## ü§ù Contributing

- Additional security checks
- Integration with more security tools
- Enhanced reporting formats
- Documentation improvements
